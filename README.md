# DNA-CLASSIFICATION

DNA classification refers to the process of categorizing DNA sequences based on their characteristics and features, such as their nucleotide composition, length, and similarity. It is used in various fields, such as genetics, bioinformatics, and forensics. DNA classification is a crucial task in the field of genomics, and this project aims to develop an efficient ML-based DNA classification model. The proposed work aims to develop an efficient ML-based DNA classification model using k-mers, Jaccard similarity, and an expert system for model selection. The dataset used in this project contains 4200 rows of strings with a maximum of 2600 characters of DNA sequences of a human. The project involves performing DNA class balance, visualizing DNA sequences, and hyperparameter tuning for Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost models. The proposed work is essential because DNA classification is a crucial task in the field of genomics, with applications in medicine, forensic science, and agriculture. Moreover, this project's approach can handle large datasets and select the most suitable model based on the given dataset's characteristics using the expert system's inference engine. The results of the proposed model demonstrate better performance in DNA classification tasks compared to existing methods. The expert system accurately recommends the most appropriate ML model for different datasets and features. Compared to existing methods, this project's expert system provides an efficient and effective solution for DNA classification tasks, making it a valuable tool in the field of genomics. Overall, this project provides an efficient and effective solution for DNA classification tasks, which can have a significant impact on various fields like medicine, forensic science, and agriculture.
